# hello.world

I'm Savy, fellow traveler on spaceship earth.

I like staring at my computer screen. I find happiness in breath of the wild binges, game of thrones, anything miyazaki, my two year old iggy targa, eating morning mangos in san miguel de allende in the summer and gorging on gruyère fondue in gstaad in the winter. 

Moon tacos are good, too.
